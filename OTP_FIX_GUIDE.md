# OTP Email Verification Fix Guide

## Problem Summary
The OTP email verification system was not storing data in PostgreSQL tables and not sending OTP emails to users.

## Files Created for Debugging
1. `send_otp_debug.php` - Debug version of the OTP sending script
2. `verify_otp_debug.php` - Debug version of the OTP verification script
3. `assets/js/auth_debug.js` - Debug version of the auth JavaScript 
4. `otp_test.html` - Test page for OTP functionality
5. `db_debug.php` - Database debugging script

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Incorrect API Endpoints in Frontend JavaScript
- **Problem**: In `auth.js`, the frontend was using incorrect endpoints (`robust_otp.php` and `robust_verify_otp.php`)
- **Fix**: Updated to use the correct endpoints (`send_otp.php` and `verify_otp.php`)

### Issue 2: SQL Schema Error
- **Problem**: The `categories` table had an error in the `updated_at` column default value (`CURRENT_TIMESTAMPTAMP`)
- **Fix**: Corrected to use `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`

### Issue 3: Potential Database and Email Issues
- Created debug versions of the PHP scripts with detailed error logging
- Test pages to isolate issues with database connections and email sending

## How to Test the Fix

1. **Use the Test Page**:
   - Open `http://localhost/Finance/otp_test.html` in your browser
   - Enter a name and email to test the OTP sending
   - Use the received OTP to test verification

2. **Check Database Records**:
   - Open `http://localhost/Finance/db_debug.php` to view OTP records
   - This page also tests database insertion to verify it's working

3. **View Debug Information**:
   - Check `c:\wamp64\logs\php_error.log` for detailed error messages
   - These logs will show issues with database connections or email sending

## Implementing the Fix in Production

After confirming everything works in the debug versions:

1. Update `auth.js` to use the correct endpoints:
   - Replace `robust_otp.php` with `send_otp.php`
   - Replace `robust_verify_otp.php` with `verify_otp.php`

2. Fix the SQL schema in `finance_schema.sql`:
   - Replace `CURRENT_TIMESTAMPTAMP` with `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` 
   - Re-run this SQL if needed

3. Check Email Configuration:
   - Ensure your Gmail account is set up for app passwords
   - Verify the password in `smtp_config.php` is correct

## Additional Notes

- The code now includes better error handling and debugging
- If you need to continue debugging, the test pages provide detailed logs
- PostgreSQL boolean and integer types are handled correctly in database operations
